h3. What is it?

* People are connected by internet all over the World
* They are generally grouped in Gangs
* They are in different Time Zones
* A Web application pointing out each of my Gang members' Time Zone, would be nice.
* I can see witch of my gang's member are probably awake.

h3. How does it begun? Who is behind it?

* I have had the idea in mid 2009.
* It was based on a original 2008 work from "Satoshi Asakawa(ashbb on Twitter)":http://twitter.com/ashbb
* Originally published in the former shoebox site, now "Hackety Hack":http://hackety.com/, then evolved into "here(gangsclock2 on github)":https://github.com/ashbb/gangsclock2/ and "here(gangsclock3 on github)":https://github.com/ashbb/gangsclock3/
* Now, in 2012 it is time to implement it in Rails 3.2.3.

h3. Primary purposes by sprint:

h4. Sprint-00 - COMPLETED

* Basic Infra Structure

h4. Sprint-01 - DEVELOPMENT

* A simple list where the user can see a list of the Gang members. 
* The current user will be placed in the middle of the list. 
* The current user UTC offset will be considered the center of the list. 
* Lower UTC offset members will be listed before current user.
* Higher UTC offset members will be listed after current user.
